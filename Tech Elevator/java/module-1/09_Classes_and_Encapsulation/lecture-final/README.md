# TE Diner Game

The TE Diner Game is a children's game. The idea is that kids can play the game and run their own kitchen in a diner. Just like in a real diner, a customer can order an item off the menu and the kitchen fills the order.

For version 1 of this game, we will offer a PB&J special, in fact, PB&J will be the only thing on the menu for our "Grand Opening". A customer needs to be able to order 1 or more PB&J sandwiches. Each PB&J costs 4.99. A customer may request extra Jelly for an additional cost of .50. A PB&J may be toasted upon customer request at no additional charge.

When the customer is done eating they will receive a receipt from their server, and they need to pay at the register. Payment can be made by Cash, Credit or BitCoin.

The cooks in the kitchen do not know how to make PB&Js so you will need to program the instructions. These are the basic instructions to follow.

NOTE: we do not use bread ends for our PB&J sandwiches because we only make premium sandwiches.
